Bootstrap: (if you don't have cue around to run the godev environment
to build cue...)

* check out cue into ~/src/cue

* build the godev environment

  cd dockerfiles/godev
  docker build .
  ... Successfully built 1123ddcc0d1f

  If you're on a Raspberry Pi, use the dockerfiles/godev-rpi
  directory instead.

ii. build cue by hand inside such a container:
  cd ~/cue (or wherever it is checked out)
  docker run --rm -ti  -v $(pwd):/cue 1123ddcc0d1f /bin/bash
  sudo -i   # to get profiles run, to get 'go' on the path
  cd /cue/src
  export GOPATH=$(pwd)
  go get cue
  go install cue

  # the build cue.go will have the wrong permissions

mkdir ~/tmp/cue

cue godev

now rebuild cue inside godev:

 cd ~/cue
 export GOPATH=$(pwd)
 go get cue 
 go install cue

jessie frazelle has Dockerfiles and commandlines for running
a bunch of apps in docker on the desktop. The main difference in
approach there is only mounting the parts of ~ that are necessary
- so more security, where `cue` is aimed at less security for your
homedir.
